          After having a summer holiday in my village,<img src="me-and-chip.jpg" alt="chip is cute"> I have taken this mouse lemur with me here in mahanoro. I have never had a mouse lemur as a pet like this before. I check him three times a day during which I give him his food. <img src="chip-on-head.jpg" alt="chip is cute"> I have learned many things about mouse lemur since I have got this pet.
