        <p>
            Anosibe An’Ala is the name of my village. It is a District in Alaotra mangoro region, Toamasina province. The way goes to my village is passing Moramanga and it’ s 75 km from there going to the south. Once in a blue moon you can go there by just simple car but most of the time we use to go by trucks because that road is one of the worst roads in Madagascar.

        <h3 id="headings">How does it look like?</h3>
        <p>
            This village is a green place decorated by forest and it is surrounded by two rivers called Manambolo and Mahamavo. Those two rivers are separated when passing the village but they are combined into one at the end of the village.
