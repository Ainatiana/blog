        <h4>How was it when i was in middle school?</h4>
        <p>I was studying in a states school several years ago.At that time, I did some part time jobs while it's free time, weekend or holyday.</p>
        <p>I and my older sister were living alone in Anosibe An'Ala and we took our food and staff in a village called Ambodiara every saturday.</p>
        <p>I used to study hard because it's been long ago that I've felt the good side and the difficulties that people come through in this life.I can understand that everyone has their problems and I am happy to tell you that challenging difficulty also can be end up with bright sides and problem can become happiness when it's resolved.</p>

        <h4>When I was in high school:</h4>
        <p>After getting my BEBC diploma in middle school, I continued my study in high school in the same town. At that time,I made lot of friends that some of them had quite similar to my ancient experiences. On top of those, i've got three bestfriends who are still closer to me so far.</p>
        <p>We used to study together as a group when outside of the class and helped each other with training  to prepare for exams and that resulted well.</p>
        <p>I got my baccalaureat diploma on 2015 with one of the top marks.</p>

        <h4>What and how is my study now?</h4>
        <p>After teaching in a little village called Ambodimerana, a NGO called ONJA, asked some students including me to have a test providing that the students who passed the test can continue their studies at Onja. </p>
        <p>It has been over a year that Ihave studied at Onja. Onja school is in Mahanoro, east of Madagascar. We have got a beautiful environment here. We did english course last year and on January this year, we have started our coding course.</p>  
        <p>We have got such an amiable, sociable and reliable teachers. I think we are doing well so far.
